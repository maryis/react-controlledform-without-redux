a react project with controlled-form concept, fetch api, bootstrap and styling

- fetching data from an api with promise-based fetch

- controlled form in react
    - every component in form is related to a state 
    - a unique handleChange for all form-components

    - to make form handling easier: use library Formik    
        
    - divide page to: smart/presentational component (separate business and present)
        or container/present component
        smart or .. : maintain state and method to change it
        present  : receive props and display things

        - react router
        - react context api instead of redux(both know)

    - react is supported by facebook team and is opensource
        so it changes regularly and we need to be up to date
